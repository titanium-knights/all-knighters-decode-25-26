    //Move 2 square to the right (don't go forward yet, still in triangle) (in parallel with squares)
    //Turn to face the rows (45 degrees) - because we start at an angle (face towards blue triangle)
    //Move right (1 square)
    //Move backward to align with the first ball (be in parallel)
    //Move left (2 squares) (push the ball back to the triangle)
    //Turn 90 degrees to push the balls into the wall
    //Move left (should be pushed fully now)
    // Move forward 2 squares
    // Move right (2 squares)
    // Move backward towards the balls again and align the robot
    // Move left( all the way to the red triangle)
    // Turn 90 degrees
    // Move left (should be pushed fully now)
